                        Phones have now become so advanced and all we think about. Phones are divided by two different brands from two different companies that people compare all the time. We have Apple that released different types of iPhones, and Android with their Samsung phones. The two are compared for their camera quality and their functionality in general. Phones now have games that we can download, access to our email without a computer, a place to store notes, listen to music, watch movies and videos, and so much more. We can access just about anything on the internet and do whatever. We can order, pay, and access the menu at restaurants. We have a voice generator in our phone to help us do things. We can read books on our phones and create different types of art, from drawings to music. Phones and technology have come a long way that our phones are like a <i>life companion</i> because of how long we have been with them, and how we don’t wish to part with them. We are constantly upgrading our phones with the latest camera quality and the bigger the size. We want more cameras and better quality. We can even have the weather app on our phones and the latest news. Instead of TVs or human contact, most people turn to their phones. It’s interesting how we come out with different iPhones and Samsung phones to give us new features to make our lives better, but it can bring us further apart if everything we are able to do is on our phones and we don’t have to go out to do certain things for it.

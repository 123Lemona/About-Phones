                     <i>The first portable telephone</i> came out in 1983 and was something that was new and easy to access for everyone. Instead of having the phone on the wall or in your car and being limited to a certain spot, they came up with the idea of being able to communicate without the need to just be at home or in your car. <i>The first portable telephone</i> came in the shape of the Motorola KynaTAC 8000X. It weighed just under a kilogram, stood 33cm high, stored 30 numbers, took 10 hours to charge,and offered 30 minutes of talk time. It cost about $4,000, which would be about $10,000 in today’s currency, and it was a sign of important significance because of the time and price. The next phone upgrade was the Motorola Microtac 9800X was considered as <i>the first portable phone</i>i because it was lighter in weight and could actually fit in people’s pockets. It was released in 1989 and could show more information and wasn’t as chunky as its predecessors. It costs between $2,495 and $3,495. The next upgrade came out in 1992 and was called the Motorola International 3200 and Nokia 1011. They were both small in size from their predecessors and had more space to hold more numbers and a longer call time. These are all of the phones that were simple in design and were used to make calls long distances before any type of game features were invented. This was just the beginning.

                      Phones were still being upgraded in their size and weight. People wanted a small phone that could fit inside of their pockets and hands comfortably. The Motorola Startac was the first clamshell cellular phone and one of the first to have a display screen in 1996. It was the first flip phone and cost $1,000. The Nokia 8110 was also released in 1996 and had 4GB of storage, faster service, and a better protection policy. It was the first Nokia high-end 8000 series of phones. It had a sliding cover that protected the keypad and was the first Nokia phone with monochrome graphic LCD. It was featured in the Matrix movie and became a big hit. Then the Siemens S10 was our <i>first look at color</i>that came out in 1997 brought the mobile phone display with four different colors. It was the first phone that had the option of adding color to the screen. You could send and receive emails and the phone would also vibrate to alert you of a message. Hagenuk launched the GlobalHandy that was the first phone that didnâ€™t have an external aerial. New themes with different color options were also starting to appear onthe market for customers. There were swappable keyboards that you could switch to with a different color. Nokia also launched a range of interchangeable covers in the following year for the 5100 series of phones.

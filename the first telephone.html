                     <i>The first ever telephone</i> came to be in 1876 from the telegraph. Before the telephone, there was the telegraph and then the radio came to be. The telegraph allowed people to communicate over long distances. From trying to improve the telegraph, the telephone came into being.  With the development of the telephone, many people wanted to be on the telephone’s system. The government had nationalized the telephone lines for communication during World War 1. Many people loved the telephone and all the positive things it could do and bring. This also led people to speculate about the possible negatives the telephone could bring. People knew that the telephone could help with job opportunities, allow people to socialize more, bring people closer together like never before, and lead to an advanced form of transmission of intelligence. The major negative factor that the telephone provided was privacy. Since you had to leave your home and travel to the store or different places to make a phone call. Homes weren’t wired together, and it wasn’t safe to have to go somewhere else to call someone or receive a call. Even though this was a major downside, many people still knew the future possibilities the telephone could provide. They would have never thought that today in age, cell phones and other types of technology have helped us tremendously in our lives. It has also made us distance ourselves from people since we can contact them from a screen. It hasn’t brought us closer together in the way that people have thought, and instead brought us further apart.

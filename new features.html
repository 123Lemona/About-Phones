                       The Nolia 7650 was released in 2002 and was the first phone in Europe that had a built-in camera. This was the first <i>ew feature</i> and big news since you could also capture moments and people without having to buy a camera. The Sony Ericsson P800 was also released in the same year. Instead of just having a built-in camera, it was also touchscreen. It was small, sleek, and light blue in color, and it came with the same color stylus pen to navigate the screen. In 2003, the Nokia N-Gage was released in response to the advance in the Game Boys. It was very popular because it allowed you to play games like a game boy, but it declined because of how chunky and thick it was. The Palmone Treo 600 was released in the same year and was a merge between a PDA, camera, and phone that made this phone popular until Blackberries. The phone was like a PDA in which you could put all of your contacts and their information. The Blackberry Quark 6210 was similar in functionality and design, but it was more intergraded. In 2004, the Soney Ericsson P910 was a flip smartphone that had full and complete access to the internet. Then the Nokia 6630 gave access to global roaming. It allowed people to connect and contact people from around the world and not just in their country. In 2005, HTC Universal was the first 3G Pocket PC phone at HTC that had the functionality of windows mobile. The phones have a better access to the internet and functionality as they continue to upgrade.

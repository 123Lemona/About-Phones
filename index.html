            <p>Telephones have come a long way from what they were before. Telephones were first invented as a way for peopele to be able to communicate from a long distance. We could only communicate from certain places that had a phone line. Many people said how dangerous it could be if you needed to make a call in the middle of the night and something could happen to you. Then, portable phones came out were you didn't have to be in just one place to make and recieve calls. They were big, chunky, and not popular with the public becuase of how big it was to carry around. Telephones were modified and remodified with different sizes and amounts of space for improvements. New features were added to the phones that you were able to take pictures and send messages and not just calls. We were then able to see color on the screens of the phones with much more space and usage. Games, pictures, emails, longer battery life, and so much more was added to phones. With the phones that we have today in the future, they are like our whole world and life. We take them everywhere and store most of our information on them. We look on the internet for things and look to our phones with the thought of talking to someone. We barely communicate with people outisde of our phones, and we are more closed off. Telephones were made so we could better contact people and make us more connected, but all it as done is divide us.</p>
